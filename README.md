<h3>Hi! ðŸ‘‹<br>I'm Ezekiel Kim<br> a Student, Mobile App Developer & Writer </h3>
<h6>I build <a href="https://github.com/zekekim/pinkypromise">apps</a> and write my own <a href="https://zekekim.github.io/">blogs</a>. <br> I have 2 years of experience with SwiftUI, and have just picked up Flutter as my main SDK.
Pinky Promise is my main project that I'm working on at the moment, and I'm looking to release it by the end of the spring semester in 2022.
